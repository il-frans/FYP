\section{Implementation}

• In case of a software development describing of all the code in the system should be avoided as well as large “pieces” of code. Complete source code listings should be put on the accompanying digital media (e.g. CD or DVD). In case of hardware the system should be divided into sub systems or circuits that may be easily described and analysed.
• One must be especially critical to the operation of the system.
• Mentioning unforeseen problems encountered during implementation.
• Explanation of a seemingly disproportionate amount of project time taken up in dealing with such problems. The implementation section gives you the opportunity to show where that time has gone.
