\begin{abstract}

This study explores the research, design, development, implementation and evaluation of a novel real-time telemetry aided system for racing driving training for non-experts. It does so by starting off exploring what serious games are and their applications, what motorsport is, what is expected of a race driver and what's the state of the art of virtual sim racing. After which a system for real time feedback is designed which provides auditory feedback in the form of descriptive speech while a user makes use of a racing rig and a sim racing game. User studies are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.  Evaluation is based on the collected telemetry data and questionnaires filled out by participants. Initial results are encouraging, indicating that there is potential for performance gain and driver confidence enhancement based on the audio feedback.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I am extremely thankful and indebted to Dr Keith Bugeja and Dr Sandro Spina for sharing their expertise, and sincere and valuable guidance and time, and encouragement during this work. Their systematic approach and eye for detail have allowed this project to became of much higher quality than it would have otherwise have been. 

I wish to express my sincere thanks to Luke Chircop, for providing the required sim rig hardware for this project. Without his contribution it would have been much harder for this project to source the hardware for the experiments.
