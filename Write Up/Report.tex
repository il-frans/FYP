\begin{abstract}
Motorsports, like all major forms of sporting activities, requires training and dedication to master, supplemented by hours of rote learning and mentoring by experts. This study explores the question of whether a serious game is a powerful enough pedagogical tool to be fruitfully employed in the training of race drivers. A system of heuristics is proposed for a novel telemetry-based feedback model for contextual real-time suggestions. The model has been integrated into a racing simulation game and a study of its performance is reported here. The study consists of 27 participants, partitioned into two groups, to provide a control for the experiment. Two questionnaires have been used to acquire demographic information about the participants and help control for factors such as experience.

Quantitative results show that there is an improvement for the group using the feedback system, although this improvement dissipates when the feedback is disabled again for the experimental group.

Analysis of the initial results are encouraging, with the model showing promise. Additionally besides the model, the lack of cognitive retention when feedback was disabled merits investigation and future work.

%This study explores the research, design, development, implementation and evaluation of a novel real-time telemetry aided system for racing driving training for non-experts. It does so by starting off exploring what serious games are and their applications, what motorsport is, what is expected of a race driver and what's the state of the art of virtual sim racing. After which a system for real time feedback is designed which provides auditory feedback in the form of descriptive speech while a user makes use of a racing rig and a sim racing game. User studies are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.  Evaluation is based on the collected telemetry data and questionnaires filled out by participants. Initial results are encouraging, indicating that there is potential for performance gain and driver confidence enhancement based on the audio feedback.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I am extremely thankful and indebted to Dr Keith Bugeja and Dr Sandro Spina for sharing their expertise, and sincere and valuable guidance, time and encouragement during this work. Their systematic approach and eye for detail have allowed this project to be of much higher quality than it would have otherwise been. 

I wish to express my sincere thanks to Luke Chircop, for helping acquire the simulation racing rig hardware required for this project. Without his contribution it would have been very difficult to procure the hardware for the experiments.
