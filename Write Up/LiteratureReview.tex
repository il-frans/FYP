This chapter provides a brief exposition of the state of the art and related work in race driving simulation. The chapter starts by drawing a distinction between video games and serious games, and motivates this demarcation. This is followed by a discussion of the pedagogical aspect of serious games. Finally, an overview of simulation racing is given, with a focus on the genre's intersection between entertainment and pedagogical factors.

\section{Video Games and Serious Games}
Baranowski et al \cite{yuserious} define games as a physical or mental contest with a goal or objective, played according to a framework, or rule, that determines what a player can or cannot do inside a game world. The definition covers the setup of a game, while a physical or mental contest, played according to specific rules, with the goal of amusing or rewarding the participant the reward aspect of games.

Video games are built on top of these core values with the addition of having the game world confined to some sort of digital medium. The first video game was created by William Higinbotham; it was a tennis game to be played on a television set\cite{stanton2015brief}. From the early days of video games, their main aim was always to provide some degree of entertainment. The entertainment value is achieved in various ways depending on the gaming platform, game genre and the target audience. Modern video games are simply made up of three fundamental components: story, art and software \cite{zyda2005visual}.

Serious games are considered a mixture of simulation and video game to provide some form of education\cite{abt1970}. The idea behind serious games is to connect a serious purpose to knowledge and technologies from the video game industry\cite{michael2005serious}. The boundaries of serious games are debated, mostly due to the fact that they attract multiple domains making it hard to come up with a common boundary. However, the common denominator across all domains seems to be serious game designers use people's interest in video games to capture their attention for a variety of purposes that go beyond pure entertainment\cite{djaouti2011classifying}.

The main difference between video games and serious games is the use of pedagogic activities which aim to educate or instruct in the latter, as opposed to the purely leisurely aspects of video games\cite{zyda2005visual}. Pedagogy is given preference over the amusement value which in some cases might be missing in serious games \cite{zyda2005visual}. All serious games involve some form of learning; they educate the player with a specific type of content, whereas video games simply aim to entertain the player\cite{Harteveld2007}. Since the main objective of video game designers is to make the game fun, the content and controls should be at the service of making the game entertaining. On the other hand, serious game designers have multiple objectives; they need to create a compelling (and possibly fun) game, but which fulfils some ulterior goal such as educating the player.  From this it follows that three aspects are essential for a serious game: fun, learning and validity\cite{Harteveld2007}.

\subsection{Pedagogy}
In order to produce a valid pedagogical experience, learning objectives, target groups and challenges needs to be clearly identified before designing a serious game\cite{moser2002methodology}. Various pedagogical theories exist which can be applied to a serious game, some of which are behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism and situated learning\cite{egenfeldt2005beyond}; a number of properties can be synthesised from these theories: 

\begin{description}
\item[Experience] Games tend to provide learning-by-doing. Many games make use of pop-up windows with extensive amount of text that are supposed to have educational value. This technique could provide too much information, time pressure or other factors inside a game environment which could potentially lead to cognitive overload or lead a person to filtering out critical information\cite{egenfeldt2005beyond}.

\item[Exploration] An important property of a game is that of requiring an active, participative attitude of the learner. The game world, including rules, mechanics and environment need to be explored and discovered by the learner. Many poorly designed games force the player to do something, while they should just let the player figure it out or at least guide the player into doing so.

\item[Incremental] The learning process should occur incrementally as it will otherwise prove too demanding for a player; that is the way the human brain functions\cite{moser2002methodology}.
\end{description}

There are various channel or media through which teaching and learning can occur; these channels are constrained by the capabilities and limitations of the target user demographic. The three main channels considered are visual, auditory and kinaesthetic. Some instructions might be better conveyed through visual cues, while other instructions work better when communicated through auditory or kinaesthetic means. Leahy et al. show that a mix of media or channels work better, with one complementing the other\cite{leahy2003auditory}. For instance, in cases where timing is a factor, having a visual image further complemented with an audio stream or vice versa may reinforce knowledge acquisition in the learner. A further consideration has to be made when applying this to the vehicle driving context; it is important avoid or at least mitigate the effect channels might have on the concentration of the driver\cite{engstrom2005effects}. 

\section{Racing Simulation Games}
Racing simulation games (sim racing) such as Asseto Corsa~\cite{assestoCorsa} and Project CARS~\cite{ProjectCars}, which are off-the-shelf products, provide a sim racing experience within budget for the average video game consumer. The aim with such games is to replicate real life cars, race car dynamics and track locations to amuse and entertain the player. The challenge aspect is achieved by pitting the user against other computer drivers known as AI players, or in multiplayer online races, which are played against other human players. In some cases, a user can compete against oneself by taking on a ghost - a recording of the player's best lap for a particular track. Sim racing the definition of what a video game is however, they miss the pedagogy activities which would qualify them as serious games. Most of the modern sim racing games do aid the player to improve by means of implementing aids. Such aids might include showing the racing line while also highlighting the braking and acceleration points. Other aids include anti-lock brakes, traction control and stability control, these are implemented in a passive way. With the exception of the racing line, the player is not told when and what is being done wrong. This results in users having to figure out their own mistakes by means of practicing without any guidance or feedback from with the game. This final year project aims to implement a module which is plugged into an off the shelf racing simulator which. This module trains users by letting them know what is being done wrong, when it's being done wrong and most importantly how to avoid making the same mistake. Further more this project builds on the premise put forward which shows that users are able to learn road driving skills into a virtual world and then successfully applying them to the real world\cite{li2015can, vogel2006computer}. Although studies have been carried out involving training for road drivers, none have looked into teaching on racing circuits with the aim of improving racing and car handling techniques.

\section{Summary}
This chapter has provided an overview of the literature in the area of serious games, with an emphasis on its pedagogical aspects. The difference between serious and video games was clearly delineated, with the properties of each discipline clearly outlined. The pedagogical aspect of serious games was reviewed in terms of its applicability to driving simulations, stressing how important it is for these to reproduce real-world car dynamics in the virtual world for any measure of success to be achieved.
