\section{Conclusion}
The Conclusions section should be a summary of the project and a restatement of its main results,
i.e. what has been learnt and what it has achieved. An effective set of conclusions should not
introduce new material. Instead it should draw out, summarise, combine and reiterate the main
points that have been made in the body of the dissertation and present opinions based on them.
